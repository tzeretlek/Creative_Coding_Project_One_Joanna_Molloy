Project One First Draft
// Adjective:  Anxious

// aspire to have several shapes but will start with ball
// also aspire to have multiple multicolored balls
// will use integers rather than floats so it will go faster

integer  circleX;


void setup() {

	size (360,360);
	circleX = .5;

//would circleX=0 be better?
}



void draw(){

// I’m putting background in Draw so ball won’t leave trace
	
	while (x<width); //shiffman had curly bracket after while

	background (127);
         ellipse (circleX,180,20,20);
	fill (0,255,0);
	
//would like to have a ball that increases bounce speed to be super intense with each click of the mouse

int  xspeed = 5;

// I am not sure whether to use xspeed = 5  or  circleX = circleX + 5
